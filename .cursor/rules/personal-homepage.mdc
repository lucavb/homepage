# Personal Homepage Development Guidelines

This is Luca Becker's personal homepage built with Astro, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Follow these guidelines to maintain consistency and quality.

## Layout and Structure

- **ALWAYS use the existing Layout.astro** from `src/layouts/Layout.astro` for all pages
- Maintain the established component structure:
  - General components in `src/components/general/`
  - Home-specific components in `src/components/home/`
  - Use the existing Props interfaces and patterns
- Follow the existing dark/light mode implementation
- Use the established color scheme and gradient classes
- Maintain the responsive design patterns already in place

## Styling Guidelines

- Use Tailwind CSS classes exclusively
- Follow the established color scheme:
  - Primary: Blue (blue-600, blue-700)
  - Secondary: Indigo (indigo-100, indigo-700, indigo-800)
  - Gray scale for text and backgrounds
- Maintain dark mode support with `dark:` prefixes
- Use established gradient classes defined in Layout.astro
- Follow the existing spacing and typography patterns

## Component Development

- Keep components focused and reusable
- Use TypeScript interfaces for props (see `src/types/index.ts`)
- Follow the existing naming conventions
- Maintain the established animation patterns (fade-in, hover effects)
- Use consistent class structures for cards and sections

## Performance Considerations

- Always include `loading="lazy"` and `decoding="async"` for images
- Use appropriate image sizes for different breakpoints
- Maintain the established CSS animations and transitions
- Keep bundle sizes minimal

## Development Workflow

1. Use the existing component patterns
2. Test both light and dark modes
3. Ensure responsive behavior across devices
4. Follow the established TypeScript and Astro conventions

Remember: Consistency is key. Always reference existing components and maintain the established patterns and design language.
